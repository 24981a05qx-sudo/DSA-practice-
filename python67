#A monkey is given n piles of bananas, where the 'ith' pile has nums[i] bananas. 
# An integer h represents the total time in hours to eat all the bananas.

#Each hour, the monkey chooses a non-empty pile of bananas and eats k bananas. 
# If the pile contains fewer than k bananas, the monkey eats all the bananas in that pile and does not consume any more bananas in that hour.
#Determine the minimum number of bananas the monkey must eat per hour to finish all the bananas within h hours.

#Example 1

#Input: n = 4, nums = [7, 15, 6, 3], h = 8
#Output: 5
#Explanation: If Koko eats 5 bananas/hr, he will take 2, 3, 2, and 1 hour to eat the piles accordingly. So, he will take 8 hours to complete all the piles.  

#Example 2

#Input: n = 5, nums = [25, 12, 8, 14, 19], h = 5
#Output: 25
#Explanation: If Koko eats 25 bananas/hr, he will take 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 hour to eat the piles accordingly. So, he will take 5 hours to complete all the piles
