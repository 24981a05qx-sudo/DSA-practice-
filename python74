#Given an integer array a of size n and an integer k. 
# Split the array a into k non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is minimized.
#  Return the minimized largest sum of the split.

#Example 1

#Input: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
#Output:6
#Explanation: There are many ways to split the array a[] into k consecutive subarrays. The best way to do this is to split the array a[] into [1, 2, 3], [4], and [5], where the largest sum among the three subarrays is only 6.

#Example 2

#Input: a = [3,5,1], k = 3
#Output: 5
#Explanation: There is only one way to split the array a[] into 3 subarrays, i.e., [3], [5], and [1]. The largest sum among these subarrays is 5.
