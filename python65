#Given an array arr of integers of size n. A peak element is defined as an element greater than both of its neighbors.

#Formally, if arr[i] is the peak element (where i is 0-indexed), 
# then arr[i - 1] < arr[i] and arr[i + 1] < arr[i] (consider arr[-1] = arr[n] = -∞).
#Find the index(0-based) of a peak element in the array. If there are multiple peak numbers, return the index of any peak number.
#Note: As there can be many peak values, "true" is given as output if the returned index is a peak number, otherwise "false".


#Example 1

#nput : arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 1]
#Output: 7
#Explanation: In this example, there is only 1 peak that is at index 7.

#Example 2

#Input : arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]
#Output: 1
#Explanation: In this example, there are 2 peak numbers at indices 1 and 5. We can consider any of them.
