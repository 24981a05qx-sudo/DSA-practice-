#Given a sorted array of unique positive integers arr, your task is to return the kᵗʰ missing positive number that is not present in arr.

#The array is guaranteed to be strictly increasing, and the missing numbers are those positive integers that do not appear in arr but would appear in a full sequence starting from 1.

#Example 1

#Input: arr = [3, 5, 7, 10], k = 6
#Output: 9
#Explanation:
#The missing numbers are [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, ...]. The 6ᵗʰ missing number is 9.

#Example 2

#Input: arr = [1, 4, 6, 8, 9], k = 3
#Output: 5
#Explanation:
#The missing numbers are [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, ...]. The 3ʳᵈ missing number is 5.


arr = list(map(int, input("Enter the sorted array elements: ").split()))
k = int(input("Enter k (the missing number position): "))

        if missing_count == k:
            answer = current
            break
    current += 1

print("The", k, "th missing number is:", answer)
