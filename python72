#Given an array nums of size n, which denotes the positions of stalls, and an integer k, 
# which denotes the number of aggressive cows, assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two cows is the maximum possible. 
# Find the maximum possible minimum distance.

#Example 1

#Input: n = 6, k = 4, nums = [0, 3, 4, 7, 10, 9]
#Output: 3
#Explanation:
#The maximum possible minimum distance between any two cows will be 3 when 4 cows are placed at positions [0, 3, 7, 10]. Here the distances between cows are 3, 4, and 3 respectively.
#In no manner can we increase the minimum distance beyond 3.

#Example 2

#Input : n = 5, k = 2, nums = [4, 2, 1, 3, 6]
#Output: 5
#Explanation: The maximum possible minimum distance between any two cows will be 5 when 2 cows are placed at positions [1, 6].
