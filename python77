#Given a sorted array arr of size n, containing integer positions of n gas stations on the X-axis, and an integer k, place k new gas stations on the X-axis.
#The new gas stations can be placed anywhere on the non-negative side of the X-axis, including non-integer positions.
#Let dist be the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations after adding the k new gas stations.
#Find the minimum value of dist.
#Your answer will be accepted if it is within 1e-6 of the true value.

#Example 1

#Input: n = 10, arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,7, 8, 9, 10], k = 10
#Output: 0.50000
#Explanation:
#One of the possible ways to place 10 gas stations is [1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10].
#Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas stations is 0.5.
#Hence, the value of dist is 0.5.
#It can be shown that there is no possible way to add 10 gas stations in such a way that the value of dist is lower than this.

#Example 2

#Input : n = 10, arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 1
#Output: 1.00000
#Explanation:
#One of the possible ways to place 1 gas station is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
#New Gas Station is at 11.
#Thus the maximum difference between adjacent gas stations is still 1.
#Hence, the value of dist is 1.
#It can be shown that there is no possible way to add 1 gas station in such a way that the value of dist is lower than this.
