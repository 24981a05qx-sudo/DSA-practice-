#Given an integer array nums, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. 
# The array is rotated at some pivot point that is unknown. 
# Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

#Example 1

#Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 0
#Output: 4
#Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

#Example 2

#Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 3
#Output: -1
#Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.
