#Given an integer array nums of size n containing values from [1, n] and each value appears exactly once in the array, 
# except for A, which appears twice and B which is missing.

#Return the values A and B, as an array of size 2, where A appears in the 0-th index and B in the 1st index.
#Note: You are not allowed to modify the original array.


#Example 1

#Input: nums = [3, 5, 4, 1, 1]
#Output: [1, 2]
#Explanation:
#1 appears two times in the array and 2 is missing from nums

#Example 2

#Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 5, 7]
#Output: [7, 4]
#Explanation:
#7 appears two times in the array and 4 is missing from nums.

for i in range(n):
    nums.append(int(input()))
