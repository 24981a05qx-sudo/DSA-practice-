#You are given an array weights where weights[i] represents the weight of the i-th package on a conveyor belt.
#  All the packages must be shipped in the order given from one port to another within days days.



#Each day, the ship can carry a contiguous sequence of packages, as long as the total weight does not exceed its maximum capacity.


#Your task is to find the minimum possible capacity of the ship so that all packages can be shipped within the given number of days.


#Example 1

#Input: weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], days = 5
#output: 15
#Explanation:
#Minimum ship capacity = 15. One way to ship in 5 days:
#Day 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
#Day 2: 6 + 7 = 13
#Day 3: 8
#Day 4: 9
#Day 5: 10
#No day exceeds capacity 15 and all packages are shipped in order in 5 days.

#Example 2

#Input: weights = [3, 2, 2, 4, 1, 4], days = 3
#Output: 6
#Explanation:
#One possible division with capacity 6:
#Day 1: 3 + 2 = 5
#Day 2: 2 + 4 = 6
#Day 3: 1 + 4 = 5
#All packages shipped in order within 3 days.

while left <= right:

    for i in range(len(weights)):

            current_load += weights[i]
        else:
            required_days += 1
            current_load = weights[i]

    if required_days <= days:
