#You are given a sorted array of integers arr and an integer target.
#  Your task is to determine how many times target appears in arr.
#Return the count of occurrences of target in the array.


#Example 1

#Input: arr = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3], target = 1
#Output: 3
#Explanation: The number 1 appears 3 times in the array.

#Example 2

#Input: arr = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], target = 5
#Output: 6
#Explanation: All elements in the array are 5, so the target appears 6 times.
