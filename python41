#Given an integer array nums, return a list of all the leaders in the array.

#A leader in an array is an element whose value is strictly greater than all elements to its right in the given array. The rightmost element is always a leader. The elements in the leader array must appear in the order they appear in the nums array.


#Example 1

#Input: nums = [1, 2, 5, 3, 1, 2]
#Output: [5, 3, 2]
#Explanation:
#2 is the rightmost element, 3 is the largest element in the index range [3, 5], 5 is the largest element in the index range [2, 5]

#Example 2

#Input: nums = [-3, 4, 5, 1, -4, -5]
#Output: [5, 1, -4, -5]
#Explanation:
#-5 is the rightmost element, -4 is the largest element in the index range [4, 5], 1 is the largest element in the index range [3, 5] and 5 is the largest element in the range [2, 5]





nums = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers: ").split()))

n = len(nums)
leaders = []

# Step 1: Last element is always a leader
max_from_right = nums[n - 1]
leaders.append(max_from_right)

# Step 2: Traverse from right to left
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if nums[i] > max_from_right:
        max_from_right = nums[i]
        leaders.append(nums[i])

# Step 3: Reverse to maintain original order
leaders.reverse()

print("Leaders:", leaders)
