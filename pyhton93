#Given an input string, containing upper-case and lower-case letters, digits, and spaces( ' ' ). 
# A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s are separated by at least one space.

#Return a string with the words in reverse order, concatenated by a single space.


#Example 1

#Input: s = "welcome to the jungle"
#Output: "jungle the to welcome"
#Explanation: The words in the input string are "welcome", "to", "the", and "jungle". 
# Reversing the order of these words gives "jungle", "the", "to", and "welcome". 
# The output string should have exactly one space between each word.

#Example 2

#Input: s = " amazing coding skills "
#Output: "skills coding amazing"
#Explanation: The input string has leading and trailing spaces, 
# as well as multiple spaces between the words "amazing", "coding", and "skills". 
# After trimming the leading and trailing spaces and reducing the multiple spaces between words to a single space, 
# the words are "amazing", "coding", and "skills". Reversing the order of these words gives "skills", "coding", and "amazing". 
# The output string should not have any leading or trailing spaces and should have exactly one space between each word
