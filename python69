#Given an array of integers nums and an integer limit as the threshold value, 
# find the smallest positive integer divisor such that upon dividing all the elements of the array by this divisor, 
# the sum of the division results is less than or equal to the threshold value.

#After dividing each element by the chosen divisor, take the ceiling of the result (i.e., round up to the next whole number).

#Example 1

#nput: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], limit = 8
#Output: 3
#xplanation: We can get a sum of 15(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) if we choose 1 as a divisor. 
#The sum is 9(1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3) if we choose 2 as a divisor. Upon dividing all the elements of the array by 3, we get 1,1,1,2,2 respectively. Now, their sum is equal to 7 <= 8 i.e. the threshold value. So, 3 is the minimum possible answer.

#Example 2

#Input: nums = [8,4,2,3], limit = 10
#Output: 2
#Explanation: If we choose 1, we get 17 as the sum. If we choose 2, we get 9 (4+2+1+2) <= 10 as the answer. So, 2 is the answer.
