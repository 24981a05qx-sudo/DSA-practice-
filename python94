#Implement the function myAtoi(s) which converts the given string s to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to the C/C++ atoi function).

#Steps to Implement:

#First, ignore any leading whitespace characters ' ' until the first non-whitespace character is found.
#Check the next character to determine the sign. If it’s a '-', the number should be negative. If it’s a '+', the number should be positive. If neither is found, assume the number is positive.
#Read the digits and convert them into a number. Stop reading once a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. Leading zeros should be ignored during conversion.
#The result should be clamped within the 32-bit signed integer range: [-2147483648, 2147483647]. If the computed number is outside this range, return -2147483648 if the number is less than -2147483648, or return 2147483647 if the number is greater than 2147483647.
#Finally, return the computed number after applying all the above steps.

#Example 1

#Input: s = " -12345"
#Output: -12345
#Explanation:
#Ignore leading whitespaces.
#The sign '-' is encountered, indicating the number is negative.
#Digits 12345 are read and converted to -12345.


#Example 2

#Input: s = "4193 with words"
#Output: 4193
#Explanation:
#Read the digits 4193 and stop when encountering the first non-digit character (w).
