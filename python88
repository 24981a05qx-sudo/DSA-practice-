#You are given a string s. Return the array of unique characters, sorted by highest to lowest occurring characters.

#If two or more characters have same frequency then arrange them in alphabetic order.

#Example 1

#Input : s = "tree"
#Output : ['e', 'r', 't' ]
#Explanation :
#The occurrences of each character are as shown below :
#e --> 2
#r --> 1
#t --> 1.
#The r and t have same occurrences , so we arrange them by alphabetic order.

#Example 2

#Input : s = "raaaajj"
#Output : ['a' , 'j', 'r' ]
#Explanation :
#The occurrences of each character are as shown below :

a --> 4

j --> 2

r --> 1
