#Given an integer array nums of size n, sorted in ascending order with distinct values. 
# The array has been right rotated an unknown number of times, between 0 and n-1 (including). Determine the number of rotations performed on the array.

#Example 1

#Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]
#Output: 4
#Explanation: The original array should be [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 4 times.

#Example 2

#Input: nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
#Output: 3
#Explanation: The original array should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. So, we can notice that the array has been rotated 3 times.
