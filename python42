#Given an array nums of n integers.

#Return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The integers in this sequence can appear in any order.


#Example 1

#Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
#Output: 4
#Explanation:
#The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4. This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.

#Example 2

#Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
#Output: 9
#Explanation:
#The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which has a length of 9. 



nums = list(map(int, input("Enter numbers: ").split()))

num_set = set(nums)   # remove duplicates + fast lookup
longest = 0

for num in num_set:
    # Only start counting if it's the beginning of a sequence
    if num - 1 not in num_set:
        current = num
        length = 1

        while current + 1 in num_set:
            current += 1
            length += 1

        longest = max(longest, length)

print("Longest consecutive length:", longest)
